# portfolio-project
-This is my first portfolio project. This project was built with HTML CSS and Bootstrap. 
-This project made me gain more insight in responsive designs.
-I was able to use CSS Grid and flexbox simultaneously.
-Getbootstrap.com- very helpful link, contains everything you need to know about bootstrap
-Used CSS utility classes to make my code look more efficient and neat.
